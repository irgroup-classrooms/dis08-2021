    "__CSV__ and __JSON__ are common plaintext formats for storing data. They are easy for programs to parse while still being human readable, so they are often used for simple spreadsheets or web app data. The `csv` and `json` modules greatly simplify the process of reading and writing to CSV and JSON files.\n",

    "The last lectures have taught you how to basically handle different data structures in Python, like lists or dictionaries, and how to read content from files. One common task is taking data from a variety of formats and parsing it for the particular information you need. These tasks are often specific to the point that commercial software is not optimally helpful. By writing your own scripts, you can make the computer handle large amounts of data presented in these formats."

    "\n",
    "Now we will finally start to use Python for something useful - we would like to remove the header from CSV files. Of course, for one single file, we don't need a Python progam to do this. But think of a folder full of hundreds of CSV files! For these repetitive task, Python is the perfect tool! Think again about the inital XKCD comic I showed you.\n",

    "The program will need to open every file with the .csv extension in the current working directory, read in the contents of the CSV file, and rewrite the contents without the first row to a file of the same name. This will replace the old contents of the CSV file with the new, headless contents.\n",

    "As always, whenever you write a program that modifies files, be sure to backup the files, first just in case your program does not work the way you expect it to. You don’t want to accidentally erase your original files.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a *high level*, the program must do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find all the CSV files in the current working directory.\n",
    "2. Read in the full contents of each file.\n",
    "3. Write out the contents, skipping the first line, to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the *code level*, this means the program will need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loop over a list of files from `os.listdir()`, skipping the non-CSV files.\n",
    "2. Create a CSV Reader object and read in the contents of the file, using the `line_num` attribute to figure out which line to skip.\n",
    "3. Create a CSV Writer object and write out the read-in data to the new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, open a new file editor window and save it as `removeCsvHeader.py`.\n",

A `for` loop on `os.listdir('.')` gets you partway there, but it will loop over all files in the working directory, so you’ll need to add some code at the start of the loop that skips filenames that don’t end with `.csv`. The `continue` statement makes the for loop move on to the next filename when it comes across a non-CSV file."
