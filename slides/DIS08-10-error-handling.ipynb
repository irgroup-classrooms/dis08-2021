    "Once testing has uncovered problems, the next step is to fix them. Many novices do this by making more-or-less random changes to their code until it seems to produce the right answer, but that’s very inefficient (and the result is usually only correct for the one case they’re testing). The more experienced a programmer is, the more systematically they debug, and most follow some variation on the rules explained below."

    "The first step in debugging something is to\n",
    "*know what it's supposed to do*.\n",

    "    If our program is supposed to simulate\n",
    "    magnetic eddies in rapidly-rotating blobs of supercooled helium,\n",

    "    if we're looking at the effects of climate change on speciation,\n",
    "    our first test should hold temperature, precipitation, and other factors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  *Compare to an oracle.*\n",
    "    A __test oracle__\n",
    "    is something whose results are trusted,\n",
    "    such as experimental data, an older program, or a human expert.\n",
    "    We use test oracles to determine if our new program produces the correct results.\n",

    "    we should store its output for particular cases\n",
    "    so that we can compare it with our new results as often as we like\n",
    "    without re-running that program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  *Check conservation laws.*\n",
    "    Mass, energy, and other quantities are conserved in physical systems,\n",
    "    so they should be in programs as well.\n",
    "    Similarly,\n",
    "    if we are analyzing patient data,\n",
    "    the number of records should either stay the same or decrease\n",
    "    as we move from one analysis to the next\n",
    "    (since we might throw away outliers or records with missing values).\n",
    "    If \"new\" patients start appearing out of nowhere as we move through our pipeline,\n",
    "    it's probably a sign that something is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  *Visualize.*\n",
    "    Data analysts frequently use simple visualizations to check both\n",
    "    the science they're doing\n",
    "    and the correctness of their code.\n",
    "    This should only be used for debugging as a last resort,\n",
