Many novices do this by making more-or-less random changes to their code until it seems to produce the right answer, but thatâ€™s very inefficient (and the result is usually only correct for the one case theyâ€™re testing). The more experienced a programmer is, the more systematically they debug, and most follow some variation on the rules explained below."

    "The first step in debugging something is to\n",
    "*know what it's supposed to do*.\n",

    "    If our program is supposed to simulate\n",
    "    magnetic eddies in rapidly-rotating blobs of supercooled helium,\n",

    "    if we're looking at the effects of climate change on speciation,\n",
    "    our first test should hold temperature, precipitation, and other factors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  *Compare to an oracle.*\n",
    "    A __test oracle__\n",
    "    is something whose results are trusted,\n",
    "    such as experimental data, an older program, or a human expert.\n",
    "    We use test oracles to determine if our new program produces the correct results.\n",
    "    If we have a test oracle,\n",
    "    we should store its output for particular cases\n",
    "    so that we can compare it with our new results as often as we like\n",
    "    without re-running that program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  *Check conservation laws.*\n",
    "    Mass, energy, and other quantities are conserved in physical systems,\n",
    "    so they should be in programs as well.\n",
    "    Similarly,\n",
    "    if we are analyzing patient data,\n",
    "    the number of records should either stay the same or decrease\n",
    "    as we move from one analysis to the next\n",
    "    (since we might throw away outliers or records with missing values).\n",
    "    If \"new\" patients start appearing out of nowhere as we move through our pipeline,\n",
    "    it's probably a sign that something is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  *Visualize.*\n",
    "    Data analysts frequently use simple visualizations to check both\n",
    "    the science they're doing\n",
    "    and the correctness of their code.\n",
    "    This should only be used for debugging as a last resort,\n",
