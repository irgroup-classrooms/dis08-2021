You are expected to work on one exercise per week that are compiled into 2 big assignments over the semester. Compile all your results into your GitHub repository. We will gather all your results from your repositories on the day of the submission deadlines. You are not required to send anything directly to us.

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Join the corresponding [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/Nshauyhh).
3. If you can't find your student id in the classroom's list, please [file an issue](https://github.com/irgroup-classrooms/dis08-2021/issues). I just need your lastname and course of study. No student id in the public list of issues, please.

### Assignment 1

[Assignment 1](assignments.md) is a personal assignment. Each student has to compile his/her own results. The submission deadline is `2021-11-26, 20 pm`. All parts of assignment 1 are pre-released so that you can look ahead what's coming up in the next weeks.
